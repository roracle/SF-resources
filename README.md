# SF-resources
Data from RaulH22 and some from the (not) official Slimefun Resource Pack repo.

This is for use on various servers, and if you would like your addon to be included, provide some graphics to be used or put in a request.  Requests might take longer than providing them yourself, as we try to focus on the Mine Struggle server.

This is a labor of love, and is licensed under the GPL version 2, but the main branch will seek to comply with compatibility standards of GPL3 so it works in the future.

This resource pack does NOT require Optifine.

SERVER OWNERS:
Place the item-models.yml file in your <serverroot>/plugins/slimefun/ directory, and overwrite the default one, then restart your server.  This is for Spigot based servers (including Paper and the likes) only.

Use at your own risk, but I can honestly say it's working pretty well so far.
